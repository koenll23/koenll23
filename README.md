# 👋 Hey, I’m **Koen**

I’m a teen maker from the Netherlands who loves building things — electronics, robotics, and creative digital projects.  
I work on whatever sparks my curiosity, from hardware to code, and I like staying active in the gym to keep balance in life.

## 🔧 What I Do  
- Build projects with **ESP32**, **microcontrollers**, and **robots**  
- Code hardware interfaces and creative software tools  
- Design **simple static websites** and small web apps
- 3D printing and **designing**
- Learn, make, and share — because creating is the best way to grow

## 🧠 Tech & Tools  
**Languages:** C, C++, C#, Node.js, Python, HTML, CSS  
**Hardware:** ESP32, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, robotics components

*Always building, always learning — one idea at a time.*
